[ ![Codeship Status for techlahoma/techlahoma_lander](https://codeship.com/projects/592cc2c0-08da-0133-eaaa-7e3d949a1704/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/90417)

This project is the landing page for the [Techlahoma Foundation - http://techlahoma.org/](http://techlahoma.org/). It is a static site built with [Middleman - http://middlemanapp.com/](http://middlemanapp.com/) and uses the [HTML5UP](http://html5up.net/) template [Strongly Typed](http://html5up.net/strongly-typed).

Getting started
==
First, install Ruby if you haven't already.
Windows users: we recommend using [Ruby Installer](http://rubyinstaller.org/).
OS X users: we recommend installing [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Ruby.
```sh
> brew install ruby
```

Now fork the [techlahoma_lander](https://github.com/techlahoma/techlahoma_lander) project into https:// github.com/_username_/techlahoma_lander

Next, clone your fork and install gems
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/username/techlahoma_lander.git
> cd techlahoma_lander
techlahoma_lander> bundle install
```

Now you can run the site locally with Middleman.
```sh
techlahoma_lander> middleman server
```

You can view the site at http://localhost:4567.

Make your changes, commit and push to your repo.
```sh
techlahoma_lander> git commit -am "my awesome changes"
techlahoma_lander> git push
```

Now open a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/techlahoma/techlahoma_lander/pulls)**, to get your changes merged into the main repo.

Build and Deploy with Middleman
==
Building and deploying run against the main repo, so you'll need to clone the main site.
```sh
> git clone https://github.com/techlahoma/techlahoma_lander.git
> cd techlahoma_lander
techlahoma_lander> bundle install
```
Now, let Middleman do it's magic.

Build it
===
```sh
techlahoma_lander> middleman build
```

Deploy it
===
The deployment will push to the `gh-pages` branch of the **techlahoma_lander** project, so you'll need write access to **techlahoma_lander** to deploy.
```sh
techlahoma_lander> middleman deploy
```

That's it! :-)
